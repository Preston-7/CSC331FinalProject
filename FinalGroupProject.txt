Group Project Ideas:


Git:

Create one main branch (Library) that will act as a main, everyone will branch off of "Library" to do their own work. Once each feature is finished the branch in which the feature is being created will be merged into "Library" which will be used a tester to make sure everything is working together before it gets merged into main


Features:
User Authentication (Admin & Members)  
Book Catalog Management  
Borrowing & Returning Books  
Search & Filter Books  
Database Integration  
UI with JavaFX  
Reports & Fine Calculation

Stack of software in use:
Frontend: JavaFX 
Backend: Java 
Database: SQLite (JDBC for database connection)
Build Tool: Maven, DB Browswer
Version Control: GitHub 
Testing: JUnit

Database:
1. Use Maven to add the SQLite JDBC dependency so Java can communicate with SQLite
2. Use DB Browser to create and test your database
3. Write Java code that connects to the database and performs CRUD operations


Project workflow
1. Set Up Maven Project (Dependencies for JavaFX, SQLite, JUnit)
2. Design UI with FXML (Main screen, book list, search bar, etc.)
3. Create Database Schema (Tables for books, members, transactions), DB Browser
4. Implement Core Features 
5. Testing & Debugging (JUnit tests for book and user management)
6. Final Deployment & Documentation
